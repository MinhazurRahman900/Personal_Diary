# Personal_Diary

# THIS PROJECT IS A CLASS WORK. SO, TILL JUNE 2023, THIS PROJECT WILL BE CLOSED. PLEASE DON'T SEND ANY PULL REQUESTS. BUT WE APPRICIATE YOUR VALUABLE COMMENTS AND IDEAS

Our goal is to create a terminal-based personal diary in C language that prioritizes security and user management. The diary will be stored in a binary file that is divided into two parts.

Seed Info: This section will contain information about the users registered on the system, including their usernames and encrypted passwords, as well as the starting points for each user's personal diary space.
User Space: Each user will have a fixed amount of space to store their diary logs. The user space will begin with a header that lists the number of logs the user currently has, followed by the log names, sizes, and starting points. The diary logs themselves will be encrypted for security purposes.
To manage user accounts, users will be able to create an account with a username and password. Upon logging in, users will be able to create new logs, access and modify existing logs, or delete logs. The program will read from the binary file and modify it if necessary, to keep the user's data up-to-date.

In addition to these primary functions, we plan to implement search and replace functionality. Users will be able to search for keywords or phrases within specific logs or across their entire diary. We will also strive to make the user interface as user-friendly as possible while still prioritizing security.

To ensure security, we will use a strong encryption algorithm to encrypt the user's data. We plan to thoroughly test the program for any vulnerabilities and make necessary modifications to ensure that our diary is secure and reliable.

Overall, our goal with this project is to learn and gain experience in C language programming and security-focused development.
